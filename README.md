# BLOOM

**BLOOM** is an educational and interactive mobile application designed to support children with Down syndrome in learning daily routines and basic academic skills in a simple, engaging, and accessible way.  
The app focuses on building **independence**, **confidence**, and **cognitive development** through guided visual and audio experiences.

---

## 🧠 Project Idea

Independence does not begin with complex tasks —  
it begins with **small, guided actions**.

BLOOM helps children with Down syndrome learn daily routines and academic basics by breaking tasks into **clear steps**, supported by **visual storytelling** and **audio guidance**, while also assisting parents and caregivers in the learning process.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Children with Down syndrome often face challenges when learning daily routines due to:
- Cognitive processing differences
- Difficulty following long or complex instructions
- Limited access to accessible, structured learning tools

Caregivers also need tools that support teaching routines in a **clear and consistent** way.

---

## 💡 Solution

BLOOM provides:
- Interactive routine scenarios
- Step-by-step visual cards
- Text-to-Speech audio guidance
- Positive reinforcement after task completion

The app is designed to reduce confusion, improve understanding, and encourage independent interaction.
